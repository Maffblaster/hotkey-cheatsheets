# Hotkey Cheatsheets

SVG graphics are great since they are text files that can be infinately scaled. That's nothing you didn't already know...but they are extra nice for creating hotkey cheatsheets since they can be exported at any resolution.

Clone this repository if you want a generic, layered hotkey cheatsheet template. This file was created with Inkscape, but it should be possible to open it using any viable SVG editors.
